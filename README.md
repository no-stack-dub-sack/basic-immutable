# easy-immutable

### About
A light-weight, single-dependency, TypeScript compatible, immutability library for JavaScript for immutably creating backwards compatible objects and arrays, with a few extra features, just for fun. Under the hood, this library is really just an immutable extension of lodash; thrown together quickly and easily; nothing too fancy here :smile:

Pass your data structure to `Immutable()` and call `toJS()` to transform them back into POJO (plain-old JavaScript objects). Full list of methods below.

### Background
I've sampled and have been heavily inspired by many of the immutability libraries out there, and while I find several of them great (and most far more sophisticated than this one), none suited my needs perfectly, and I found myself continually frustrated with the over-abundance of features, lack thereof, or the many compatibility issues that I faced. Here's a brief summary, to name a few:
- insert list items here (seamless-immutable, ImmutableJS, immutable-assign)

This is by no means a dis to any of the libraries or library authors that undoubtedly put far more work into their creations than I have into this one. Just to say that I needed something ever-so-slightly different to fit my particular needs.

However, that this library is so tailored to my needs, means that it might not be right for you, or you may simply be happier with one of the alternatives. Try it out if you'd like, otherwise, no big deal. My intent in publishing this, was just in case even one other person out there was facing the same struggles as I was, they might find this useful.
